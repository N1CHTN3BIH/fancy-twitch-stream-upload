# twitchCountdown
Twitch countdown in HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript

# Setting things up
If you want to upload your gif, just name your gif bg.gif and replace it in the root. It will get stretched, so make sure your gif animation is big enough. 

# You want to change to a static image?
Upload a image into root, go to the main.css and replace "'../bg.gif'" (line 4) with your new image, for example: '../image.jpg'.

# Set up your headline and your color in main.js
Line 29 and 31. Make sure to write a valid hex code. 

# Change duration of the Countdown
I have prepared 4 versions. A one minute, five minute, 10 minute and a 20 minute version. If you want to enable a specific one, make sure to change the URL in the Streamlabs settings from (example) twitchCountdown-master/index.html to twitchCountdown-master/five/index.html. This will enable a five minute stream duration.

If you have questions, feel free to contact me in my twitch chat or send me an mail here at Github (twitch.tv/nebih)

# Or you simply want to download NOTHING and just run this with a custom url?
